# Introduction

The tuning module described here is a targeted extension of BEMTOOL and operates exclusively on the ALADYM biological component. It does not modify, calibrate, or optimise any economic, effort-allocation, or management modules of BEMTOOL. Its sole purpose is to automate the calibration of selected ALADYM input parameters against external stock-assessment outputs.

Specifically, the tuning workflow:

- runs ALADYM repeatedly using predefined configuration files,

- varies a controlled subset of biological parameters (e.g. Tr, Fbar range, and separately the selectivity parameters),

- evaluates model outputs against assessment-derived time series,

- identifies parameter combinations that minimise a predefined error metric.

This procedure replaces manual, GUI-driven trial-and-error calibration with a deterministic, script-driven process that is fully reproducible and traceable.

The tuning framework is designed to be used after a standard BEMTOOL/ALADYM setup is already functional. It assumes that:

- ALADYM runs correctly for a single configuration,

- input data are internally consistent,

- assessment outputs (SSB, Fbar, catches) are available as reference series.


This tuning module is not a replacement for the standard BEMTOOL workflow. It is a calibration step intended to improve the biological consistency of ALADYM before running management or bioeconomic scenarios. No knowledge of BEMTOOL’s economic or management scenario modules is required to apply the tuning, in that only ALADYM parameters are tuned.

The approach is a structured grid search: no optimisation algorithm is employed. The procedure is diagnostic and comparative, not predictive.

For a full description of BEMTOOL structure, data requirements, and installation, refer to the official tutorial: [BEMTOOL Tutorial](https://coispa.github.io/BEMTOOL_tutorial_SEAwiseWP6/BEMTOOL_tutorialMSE.html).

Installation of BEMTOOL and ALADYM must be completed following that guide before attempting any tuning procedure described below.

# How to install ALADYM tuning

# Overview of the tuning workflow

The tuning process follows a fixed and sequential workflow designed to ensure consistency and reproducibility across all simulations. First, the user defines the ranges of the parameters to be explored, specifying the discrete values that will be tested during calibration. Based on these ranges, the tuning scripts automatically generate multiple ALADYM configuration files, each representing a unique parameter combination derived from the baseline setup.

ALADYM is then executed in batch mode for every generated configuration, with no manual intervention required during the simulation phase. Once all runs are completed, the relevant simulation outputs are systematically extracted and aligned with the corresponding assessment data. These simulated results are compared against observations to quantify discrepancies across time and indicators.

For each parameter combination, a numerical score is computed to summarise model performance. The combination that minimises this score is identified and stored as the best-performing solution. Finally, the tuning framework produces diagnostic plots and summary tables that allow the user to evaluate model behaviour, assess trade-offs, and verify the performance of the selected parameter set.

The tuning procedure is deliberately restricted to a defined subset of ALADYM biological parameters, ensuring that calibration targets only the processes of interest.

cat('<div style="text-align:center; font-weight:300; margin-bottom:0.5rem;">

</div>')

```

Specifically, the tuning process is a two-stage process. In **Stage 1**, the biological parameters of recruitment time _Tr_ and the age range over which fishing mortality is averaged _Fbar_ are tuned. Once the best combination is found, this is used in **Stage 2** to tune the fleet- and gear-specific selectivity parameters. This stage evaluates both stock-level and fleet-level consistency.

Note that the stages are executed sequentially, not jointly.

# Tr-Fbar tuning

The _Tr–Fbar_ tuning explores alternative combinations of the recruitment timing parameter _Tr_ and the age range used to compute mean fishing mortality _Fbar_. All other biological and fleet parameters are held fixed. The goal is to identify the Tr–Fbar combination that minimises the discrepancy between ALADYM outputs and stock assessment time series.

## Input data requirements

After installation of the ALADYM tuning software, a baseline ALADYM configuration must be prepared. This baseline configuration is the structural reference from which all tuning combinations are generated. Every Tr–Fbar configuration produced by the tuning scripts is a direct modification of this baseline. 


Several constraints are critical.

Natural mortality (M) files must start at age 0. Any offset in age indexing will cause misalignment between biological processes and assessment data, leading to error calculations.

Missing values in all configuration files **must be encoded as NAN**, not NA. ALADYM is not NA-aware. Using NA leads to type coercion, failed reads, or numerical propagation of missing values - NAN is explicitly handled by the model and by the tuning scripts.

The ALADYM configuration file used here is not the same as the BEMTOOL configuration file. BEMTOOL wraps ALADYM but applies additional preprocessing and abstractions. The tuning workflow operates directly on ALADYM inputs. A template ALADYM configuration file adapted for tuning is provided
<a href="aladym_config.csv" download>
here.

```{r, echo=FALSE, results='markup', message=FALSE}

csv_ex <- read.csv("C:\\Users\\Nazareno Campioni\\Desktop\\ALADYM_tuning_tutorial\\aladym_config.csv", sep = ';', header = TRUE)

csv_ex[is.na(csv_ex)] <- ""

head(csv_ex, 10)

cat('Example ALADYM configuration file.')

```


Finally, the simulation period defined in the configuration must match exactly the years available in the assessment time series used for calibration. No extrapolation or truncation is performed automatically.

## Generation of Tr–Fbar combinations

Tr–Fbar tuning is based on a grid search approach. The parameter space is discretised into a finite set of Tr values and Fbar age ranges, and ALADYM is run once for each possible combination.

The generation of parameter combinations is handled by the script:

`ALADYM_tuning_main_config.R`

This script reconstructs all mortality-related inputs so that each ALADYM run is internally consistent with the selected Tr–Fbar combination. In practice, the script performs the following operations.

It first reads a baseline ALADYM configuration file located in `C:\INPUT\ALADYM`. The script then defines the vectors of Tr values and Fbar age ranges to be explored and builds the full Cartesian product of these parameters.

For each Tr–Fbar combination, the script automatically generates three classes of files:

- M files, truncated or shifted so that natural mortality starts at the specified Tr value.

- Z files, recalculated to reflect both the selected age-grouping criterion for Fbar and the current Tr value.

- ALADYM configuration files, updated so that they reference the correct M and Z files associated with that specific combination.

All generated configuration files differ from the baseline only in the Tr definition, the Fbar age range, and the mortality file paths. Every other parameter and model setting is inherited unchanged from the baseline configuration.

Note, the script assumes the following directory structure and requirements:

1. The original baseline ALADYM configuration file must be located in
`C:\INPUT\ALADYM`.

2. Species-specific M and F input files must be stored in
`C:\INPUT\ALADYM\species_folder`.

If fishing mortality at age files are not available, the parameters **F_at_age_F** and **F_at_age_M** must be set to "None" in the baseline configuration. In this case, an **Fbar_assessment** file must be provided. All Z values will then be computed internally from the Fbar assessment data for each Tr–Fbar combination. This can be seen in the following example code.

```{r, echo=TRUE, results='asis', message=FALSE}

## paths
# input path - main folder where we can find M, F and config_file
ip <- "C:\\INPUT\\ALADYM"

# output path - where you want to save the output (usually C:\INPUT\ALADYM)
op <- "C:\\INPUT\\ALADYM"

# species folder - used for M and F files
species_folder <- "MUT1718"


# are there different M files for males and females?
M_different <- TRUE


## set the M files names -> make sure these start from age = 0 
# sex-specific files?
M_male <- "M_MUT_M.csv"
M_female <- "M_MUT_F.csv"

# instead, if they have the same file:
M_file <- "M_MUT.csv"


## if F_at_age files exist
F_at_age_M <- "F_at_age_MUT_M.csv"
F_at_age_F <- "F_at_age_MUT_F.csv"
Fbar_assessment <- "None"

# otherwise, if there is only an Fbar file coming from the assessment
# F_at_age_M <- "None"
# F_at_age_F <- "None
# Fbar_assessment <- "Fbar_assessment_MUT.csv"

## set initial configuration file -> must live in C:\INPUT\ALADYM
## make sure that NA values are specified as NAN (needed for the splitting)
configuration <- "aladym_MUT_GSA17_18.csv"

## set tr
tr = c(0, 1, 2, 3)

## set F_range over which to calculate Fbar, eg: list(c(0,3),c(1,4))
# if you only have Fbar from assessment, set F_range = None

F_range = list(c(0,1),c(2,3),c(4,5))
# F_range = "None"


## time series
ts = c(2004:2024)

## species
spe = 'MUT'

```

```{r, message=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
cat('Example of input paths for the creation of different ALADYM configuration files.')
```

All generated files are written automatically to `C:\INPUT\ALADYM`. The naming convention encodes the Tr value and the Fbar age range directly in the filename, allowing each simulation to be uniquely identified and unambiguously traced back to its parameter values.

Two examples of the naming convention are as follows:

1. `config_run_0_1-3.csv` means the configuration file considers `tr = 0` and `Fbar = (1-3)`;
2. `config_run_0_assess.csv` means the configuration file considers `tr = 0` and uses the `Fbar` range used in the assessment.

Once `ALADYM_tuning_main_config.R` has completed execution, no further manual editing of M files, Z files, or configuration files is required.

## Running the Tr–Fbar tuning

Once all Tr–Fbar configuration files have been generated, the tuning phase is launched by clicking on the _source_ button in the file

`ALADYM_tuning.R`.

This script operates the full calibration workflow. It iterates sequentially over all Tr–Fbar configuration files created in the previous step by launching ALADYM in batch mode for each configuration without requiring user interaction.

For every Tr–Fbar combination, the script extracts annual time series of spawning stock biomass (SSB), Fbar, and total catch from the ALADYM outputs, which are then compared against the corresponding assessment data. Relative errors are computed, and a scalar score is calculated for each combination as the sum of mean squared relative errors across all indicators (see next section).

## Outputs and diagnostics

The calibration score is defined as the sum of mean squared relative errors between simulated and assessment time series for SSB, Fbar, and total catch. For each indicator $X$, the relative error is computed as

$$
Err_t = \frac{X_t^{sim} - X_t^{obs}}{X_t^{sim}},
$$
and the total score is

$$
Score = \frac{1}{T} \sum_{t=1}^T (Err_t^{SSB})^2 + \frac{1}{T} \sum_{t=1}^T (Err_t^{Fbar})^2 + \frac{1}{T} \sum_{t=1}^T (Err_t^{Catch})^2. 
$$
The use of squared relative errors ensures scale-independence across indicators with different magnitudes and penalises large deviations more strongly than small ones.

All results are accumulated into a single calibration table that links each Tr–Fbar combination to its diagnostic metrics and overall score, found in the `Combo_runs_diagnostics` folder.


<p align="center">
  <img src="calibration_table.png" width="60%">

library(kableExtra)

cat('<div style="text-align:center; font-weight:300; margin-bottom:0.5rem;">
Figure 2 - Calibration table.
</div>')

```

In parallel, the script creates a dedicated output folder for each parameter combination. Each folder contains the full set of diagnostic plots and intermediate results associated with that specific run, allowing post hoc inspection of individual simulations.

At the end of the tuning process, the script identifies the Tr–Fbar combination with the lowest total score. This best-performing configuration is recorded in a plain text file that reports the selected Tr value, Fbar age range, and associated score. In addition, two summary output directories are produced: one containing the diagnostics for all tested combinations, and a second containing only the diagnostics associated with the best-performing configuration.

cat('<div style="text-align:center; font-weight:300; margin-bottom:0.5rem;">

```

All output folders and files generated by `ALADYM_tuning.R` are written to the same directory in which the tuning script lives. No automatic cleanup is performed. To maintain an organised project structure, it is recommended to manually create a species-specific folder and move all tuning outputs into that location once the procedure has completed, as shown below:

# Selectivity tuning

Selectivity tuning is performed only after the Tr–Fbar tuning stage has converged. The optimal Tr–Fbar combination is treated as fixed input. Selectivity tuning explores alternative gear-specific selectivity parameterisations while holding recruitment timing, fishing mortality structure, and all biological parameters constant.

This is a controlled second-stage calibration. The objective is to improve fleet-specific catch dynamics without destabilising stock-level indicators.

## Input data requirements 

Selectivity is defined at the fleet-segment level. Each fleet is associated with:

- a selectivity type identifier,

- a fixed number of parameter slots (six in the input file),

- a subset of those parameters actually used, depending on the selectivity type.

The selectivity input file is rectangular by design: all fleets share the same column structure, even if some parameters are unused. Unused parameters must still be present and must be left empty.

## Definition of parameter ranges

Selectivity tuning is driven by user-defined parameter ranges. For each parameter involved in a given selectivity type, a discrete set of candidate values is specified.

These ranges are defined in R as simple numeric vectors. The tuning scripts do not assume continuity or bounds; they only enumerate combinations.

Only parameters that are active for a given selectivity type are included in the combination space. The remaining parameter slots are left unchanged from the baseline configuration.

## Generation of selectivity configurations

Configuration generation is handled by the selectivity tuning scripts. Internally, the process follows three steps:

1. The selectivity file is split by fleet segment.

2. For each fleet, all valid parameter combinations are generated using a Cartesian product over the active parameters.

3. Full-model configurations are created by combining fleet-level parameter choices across fleets.

The result is a set of complete ALADYM configurations, each corresponding to one unique multi-fleet selectivity setup. Each configuration modifies only the selectivity file; all other inputs remain identical to the optimal Tr–Fbar baseline.

Configuration folders are named systematically to encode the selectivity parameter combination. This naming is later used to aggregate results and compute scores.

## Running selectivity tuning

Once configuration files are generated, the selectivity tuning run is launched in batch mode. For each configuration, ALADYM is executed and the following outputs are extracted:

- stock-level indicators (SSB, Fbar, total catch),

- fleet-specific annual catches.

Relative errors are computed both at the stock level and at the fleet level. Fleet errors are retained explicitly rather than collapsed immediately, allowing inspection of trade-offs between fleets.

A global score is computed by combining stock-level errors with fleet-level error summaries. The weighting scheme is transparent and can be modified if required.

## Outputs and diagnostics

Selectivity tuning produces:

- a comprehensive error table with one row per configuration,

- fleet-specific error metrics,

- diagnostic plots showing simulated versus observed catches for each fleet,

- aggregated plots showing all selectivity simulations against observations.

The best-performing configuration is identified based on the defined score criterion, but alternative near-optimal solutions can be inspected to evaluate robustness and fleet trade-offs.
