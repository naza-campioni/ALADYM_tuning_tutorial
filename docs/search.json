This baseline configuration is the structural reference from which all tuning combinations are generated. Every Tr–Fbar or selectivity configuration produced by the tuning scripts is a direct modification of this baseline.\nSeveral constraints are critical.\nNatural mortality (M) files must start at age 0. Any offset in age indexing will cause silent misalignment between biological processes and assessment data, invalidating error calculations.\nMissing values in all configuration files must be encoded as NAN, not NA. ALADYM is not NA-aware. Using NA leads to type coercion, failed reads, or numerical propagation of missing values - NAN is explicitly handled by the model and by the tuning scripts.\nThe ALADYM configuration file used here is not the same as the BEMTOOL configuration file. BEMTOOL wraps ALADYM but applies additional preprocessing and abstractions. The tuning workflow operates directly on ALADYM inputs. A template ALADYM configuration file adapted for tuning is provided  here. \n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\nExample ALADYM configuration file.\n\n\nFinally, the simulation period defined in the configuration must match exactly the years available in the assessment time series used for calibration. No extrapolation or truncation is performed automatically."

    "section": "Generation of Tr–Fbar combinations",
    "text": "Generation of Tr–Fbar combinations\nTr–Fbar tuning is based on a grid search approach. The parameter space is discretised into a finite set of Tr values and Fbar age ranges, and ALADYM is run once for each possible combination.\nThe generation of parameter combinations is handled by the script:\nALADYM_tuning_main_config.R\nThis script reconstructs all mortality-related inputs so that each ALADYM run is internally consistent with the selected Tr–Fbar combination. In practice, the script performs the following operations.\nIt first reads a baseline ALADYM configuration file located in C:\\INPUT\\ALADYM. The script then defines the vectors of Tr values and Fbar age ranges to be explored and builds the full Cartesian product of these parameters.\nFor each Tr–Fbar combination, the script automatically generates three classes of files:\n\nM files, truncated or shifted so that natural mortality starts at the specified Tr value.\nZ files, recalculated to reflect both the selected age-grouping criterion for Fbar and the current Tr value.\nALADYM configuration files, updated so that they reference the correct M and Z files associated with that specific combination.\n\nAll generated configuration files differ from the baseline only in the Tr definition, the Fbar age range, and the mortality file paths. Every other parameter and model setting is inherited unchanged from the baseline configuration.\nNote, the script assumes the following directory structure and requirements:\n\nThe original baseline ALADYM configuration file must be located in C:\\INPUT\\ALADYM.\nSpecies-specific M and F input files must be stored in C:\\INPUT\\ALADYM\\species_folder.\n\nIf fishing mortality at age files are not available, the parameters F_at_age_F and F_at_age_M must be set to “None” in the baseline configuration. In this case, an Fbar_assessment file must be provided. All Z values will then be computed internally from the Fbar assessment data for each Tr–Fbar combination. This can be seen in the following example code.\n## paths\n# input path - main folder where we can find M, F and config_file\nip &lt;- \"C:\\\\INPUT\\\\ALADYM\"\n\n# output path - where you want to save the output (usually C:\\INPUT\\ALADYM)\nop &lt;- \"C:\\\\INPUT\\\\ALADYM\"\n\n# species folder - used for M and F files\nspecies_folder &lt;- \"MUT1718\"\n\n\n# are there different M files for males and females?\nM_different &lt;- TRUE\n\n\n## set the M files names -&gt; make sure these start from age = 0 \n# sex-specific files?\nM_male &lt;- \"M_MUT_M.csv\"\nM_female &lt;- \"M_MUT_F.csv\"\n\n# instead, if they have the same file:\nM_file &lt;- \"M_MUT.csv\"\n\n\n## if F_at_age files exist\nF_at_age_M &lt;- \"F_at_age_MUT_M.csv\"\nF_at_age_F &lt;- \"F_at_age_MUT_F.csv\"\nFbar_assessment &lt;- \"None\"\n\n# otherwise, if there is only an Fbar file coming from the assessment\n# F_at_age_M &lt;- \"None\"\n# F_at_age_F &lt;- \"None\n# Fbar_assessment &lt;- \"Fbar_assessment_MUT.csv\"\n\n## set initial configuration file -&gt; must live in C:\\INPUT\\ALADYM\n## make sure that NA values are specified as NAN (needed for the splitting)\nconfiguration &lt;- \"aladym_MUT_GSA17_18.csv\"\n\n## set tr\ntr = c(0, 1, 2, 3)\n\n## set F_range over which to calculate Fbar, eg: list(c(0,3),c(1,4))\n# if you only have Fbar from assessment, set F_range = None\n\nF_range = list(c(0,1),c(2,3),c(4,5))\n# F_range = \"None\"\n\n\n## time series\nts = c(2004:2024)\n\n## species\nspe = 'MUT'\n\n\nExample of input paths for the creation of different ALADYM configuration files.\n\n\nAll generated files are written automatically to C:\\INPUT\\ALADYM. The naming convention encodes the Tr value and the Fbar age range directly in the filename, allowing each simulation to be uniquely identified and unambiguously traced back to its parameter values.\nTwo examples of the naming convention are as follows:\n\nconfig_run_0_1-3.csv means the configuration file considers tr = 0 and Fbar = (1-3);\nconfig_run_0_assess.csv means the configuration file considers tr = 0 and uses the Fbar range used in the assessment.\n\nOnce ALADYM_tuning_main_config.R has completed execution, no further manual editing of M files, Z files, or configuration files is required."

These files are derived from the landings and assessment datasets that have been previously converted into ALADYM-compatible format. No conversion or preprocessing of assessment data is performed at this stage: the tuning procedure assumes that the assessment SSB, Fbar, and catch time series are already present and correctly formatted.\nOnce all Tr–Fbar–specific configuration files have been generated, the tuning phase is launched using:\nALADYM_tuning.R\nThis script orchestrates the full calibration workflow. It iterates sequentially over all Tr–Fbar configuration files created in the previous step and launches ALADYM in batch mode for each configuration without requiring user interaction.\nFor every Tr–Fbar combination, the script extracts annual time series of spawning stock biomass (SSB), Fbar, and total catch from the ALADYM outputs. These simulated quantities are then compared against the corresponding assessment data. Relative errors are computed, and a scalar score is calculated for each combination as the sum of mean squared relative errors across all indicators."

In parallel, the script creates a dedicated output folder for each parameter combination. Each folder contains the full set of diagnostic plots and intermediate results associated with that specific run, allowing post hoc inspection of individual simulations.\nAt the end of the tuning process, the script identifies the Tr–Fbar combination with the lowest total score. This best-performing configuration is recorded in a plain text file that reports the selected Tr value, Fbar age range, and associated score. In addition, two summary output directories are produced: one containing the diagnostics for all tested combinations, and a second containing only the diagnostics associated with the best-performing configuration.\nAll output folders and files generated by ALADYM_tuning.R are written to the same directory in which the tuning script resides. No automatic cleanup is performed. To maintain an organised project structure, it is recommended to manually create a species-specific folder and move all tuning outputs into that location once the procedure has completed.\nFor each Tr–Fbar combination, ALADYM outputs are saved in a dedicated folder named after the parameter combination. These folders contain the extracted annual time series used for calibration.\n** ADD EXAMPLE FOLDER NAME **\nIn addition, the tuning script produces:\n\na summary table of errors and scores for all combinations,\ndiagnostic plots comparing simulations to assessment data,\nhighlighted plots for the best-performing Tr–Fbar combination.\n\nThese outputs allow both quantitative comparison and visual inspection of model behaviour across the explored parameter space.\nThis concludes the Tr–Fbar tuning stage. Subsequent tuning steps, such as selectivity calibration, build directly on the optimal Tr–Fbar configuration identified here."
