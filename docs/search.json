    "text": "Input data requirements\nAfter installation of the ALADYM tuning software, a baseline ALADYM configuration must be prepared. This baseline configuration is the structural reference from which all tuning combinations are generated. Every Tr–Fbar or selectivity configuration produced by the tuning scripts is a direct modification of this baseline.\nSeveral constraints are critical.\nNatural mortality (M) files must start at age 0. Any offset in age indexing will cause silent misalignment between biological processes and assessment data, invalidating error calculations.\nMissing values in all configuration files must be encoded as NAN, not NA. ALADYM is not NA-aware. Using NA leads to type coercion, failed reads, or numerical propagation of missing values - NAN is explicitly handled by the model and by the tuning scripts.\nThe ALADYM configuration file used here is not the same as the BEMTOOL configuration file. BEMTOOL wraps ALADYM but applies additional preprocessing and abstractions. The tuning workflow operates directly on ALADYM inputs. A template ALADYM configuration file adapted for tuning is provided here:\nADD CSV EXAMPLE HERE (example of a correctly formatted ALADYM input file, not a BEMTOOL file) LINK TO TEMPLATE CONFIGURATION – TO BE ADDED\nFinally, the simulation period defined in the configuration must match exactly the years available in the assessment time series used for calibration. No extrapolation or truncation is performed automatically."

The parameter space is discretised into a finite set of Tr values and Fbar age ranges, and ALADYM is run once for each possible combination.\nThe generation of parameter combinations is handled by the script:\nALADYM_tuning_main_config.R\nThis script performs the following operations:\n\nReads the baseline ALADYM configuration file.\nDefines the vectors of Tr values and Fbar age ranges to be explored.\nCreates all possible Tr–Fbar combinations using a Cartesian product.\nWrites a new ALADYM configuration file for each combination.\n\nEach generated configuration file differs from the baseline only in the Tr value and the Fbar age range. All other settings are inherited unchanged. The resulting configuration files are automatically written to:\nC:/INPUT/ALADYM\nThe naming convention encodes the Tr–Fbar combination, ensuring that each run can be uniquely identified and traced back to its parameter values.\n** EXAMPLE OF NAMING CONVENTION **\nOnce this script has been executed, no further manual editing of configuration files is required."
