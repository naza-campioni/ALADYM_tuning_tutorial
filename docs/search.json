    "text": "Input data requirements\nThe tuning procedure requires a fully functional baseline ALADYM configuration. This configuration must already run correctly in standalone mode before tuning is attempted.\n** ADD CSV EXAMPLE HERE **\nThe baseline configuration must satisfy the following conditions:\n\nNatural mortality (M) files must start at age 0.\nMissing values in configuration files must be encoded as NAN, not as NA.\n\nIn addition to the ALADYM configuration, the following assessment-derived time series are required:\n\nAnnual Spawning Stock Biomass (SSB)\nAnnual mean fishing mortality (Fbar), computed over a fixed reference age range\nAnnual total catch\n\nThese data are used as reference values to compute relative errors. They must be aligned by year with the ALADYM simulation outputs."

    "text": "Generation of Tr–Fbar combinations\nTr–Fbar tuning is based on a grid search approach. The parameter space is discretised into a finite set of Tr values and Fbar age ranges, and ALADYM is run once for each possible combination.\nThe generation of parameter combinations is handled by the script:\nALADYM_tuning_main_config.R\nThis script performs the following operations:\n\nReads the baseline ALADYM configuration file.\nDefines the vectors of Tr values and Fbar age ranges to be explored.\nCreates all possible Tr–Fbar combinations using a Cartesian product.\nWrites a new ALADYM configuration file for each combination.\n\nEach generated configuration file differs from the baseline only in the Tr value and the Fbar age range. All other settings are inherited unchanged. The resulting configuration files are automatically written to:\nC:/INPUT/ALADYM\nThe naming convention encodes the Tr–Fbar combination, ensuring that each run can be uniquely identified and traced back to its parameter values.\n** EXAMPLE OF NAMING CONVENTION **\nOnce this script has been executed, no further manual editing of configuration files is required."

    "text": "Running the Tr–Fbar tuning\nAfter the configuration files have been generated, the tuning itself is launched using:\nALADYM_tuning.R\nThis script automatically:\n\niterates over all Tr–Fbar configuration files,\nlaunches ALADYM in batch mode for each configuration,\nextracts annual SSB, Fbar, and total catch from the simulation outputs,\ncomputes relative errors with respect to assessment data,\ncalculates a scalar score for each combination as the sum of mean squared relative errors,\nstores results in a cumulative calibration table.\n\nThe procedure is entirely automated. No user interaction is required while the tuning is running.\nAt the end of the process, the script identifies the Tr–Fbar combination with the lowest total score and records it as the best-performing configuration.\nOutputs and diagnostics\nFor each Tr–Fbar combination, ALADYM outputs are saved in a dedicated folder named after the parameter combination. These folders contain the extracted annual time series used for calibration.\nIn addition, the tuning script produces:\n\na summary table of errors and scores for all combinations,\ndiagnostic plots comparing simulations to assessment data,\nhighlighted plots for the best-performing Tr–Fbar combination.\n\nThese outputs allow both quantitative comparison and visual inspection of model behaviour across the explored parameter space.\nThis concludes the Tr–Fbar tuning stage. Subsequent tuning steps, such as selectivity calibration, build directly on the optimal Tr–Fbar configuration identified here."
